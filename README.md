Create file `~/.vimpressrc` in the following format:

    blog_url = http://a-blog.com/
    username = admin
    password = 123456

    [Blog1]
    blog_url = https://blog1.wordpress.com/
    username = someone
    password =
    store_markdown = n

    password =

Hardcoding the password is optional. If a password is not provided the plugin will prompt for one the first time it's needed.

`store_markdown` is also optional. If not specified then Markdown text will be stored in custom fields of WordPress. If set to `n` then the Markdown text will not be stored.

### For Upgraded Users

Defining account info in `.vimrc` is now obsolesced, if you have correspond defination in `.vimrc` (for older version vimpress), they will automaticly copied into `~/.vimpressrc`, now you're safe to remove the VIMPRESS defination in `.vimrc`.

Users from the 2.x.x versions of vimrepress, need to run the `markdown_posts_upgrade.py` to upgrade the their posts data to be compatible with the 3.x.x version of vimrepress, or their Markdown source can not be used to re-edit by a newer vimrepress.
